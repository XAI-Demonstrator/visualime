Welcome to the visuaLIME documentation!
#######################################

*VisuaLIME* is an implementation of *LIME* (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) [1]
focused on producing visual local explanations for image classifiers.

In contrast to the
`reference implementation <https://github.com/marcotcr/lime>`_, *VisuaLIME*
exclusively supports image classification and gives its users full control over the
properties of the generated explanations.
It was written to produce stable, reliable, and expressive explanations at scale.

*VisuaLIME* was created as part of the
`XAI Demonstrator project <https://github.com/XAI-Demonstrator/xai-demonstrator>`_.
